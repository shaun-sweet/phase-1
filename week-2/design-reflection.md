##### The 6 phases of Web Design are:
1. Information Gathering

3. Design
4. Development
5. Testing + Delivery
6. Maintenance


# What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

My site's primary goal is to share information about myself, showcase my work, and thoughts through a blog. As well, another goal of my site is in self-motivation in seeing my personal growth and development in programming.


# What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My target audience is other DBC students and staff, and prospective employers. My site addresses my target audience by sharing reflections of my experience at DBC and achievements and projects I am able to build.


# What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

The primary “action” users will take is seeing my portfolio, reading thoughts on my experience into code, and getting in contact with me.


# What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

The main thing someone should know about design and user experience is that not every site has a one size fits all solution. Each site is unique and must be tailored in both the design and user experience to meet the users’ needs and goals. Another main thing is that with so much more focus on user-centric design, we must make the site an enjoyable experience for the user, by asking and addressing the important questions of value, usability, and accessibility among others.



# What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

UX Design is the process of improving how a person feels when interacting with an experience or product. It’s valuable because in a user-centric world, a site’s success is dependent on how the user perceives it so we must make this perception and experience as enjoyable and valuable as possible.


# Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

Being a designer, this challenge was not tedious for me at all. I go through the steps of design and UX on a daily basis, and have gone through these processes on many different and unique sites. While the material provided a good intro and basics in these processes, each organization operates differently, and puts emphasis in different areas so it was interesting to learn about a more general approach. It’s also always good to go back to the basics every so often to stay on track.
