- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

It was a smooth transition for me. I had previous experience with HTML so this was just review for me.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

I’ve used HTML5 elements before so it was more diving further and review for me. We took advantage of HTML5 elements in the peer-pairing session.


- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

Without using CSS, it was more challenging to resist the urge to style the page, especially coming into DBC as a designer. We kept with this best practice, by taking advantage of HTML5 elements, like <small> and <center>.


- What seems good and bad about HTML?

One good thing about HTML is that it’s very what-you-see-is-what-you-get. It’s the backbone of a webpage, and building block to adding content. Another good thing with HTML is that you can embed content in HTML, such as images and links. HTML also allows you to integrate other languages and technologies very seamlessly, and works well with each. This WYSIWYG approach I think can also be a negative thing about HTML. HTML can be very reliant on other languages and technologies to be appealing, especially with CSS. Another thing is that it can take a long time to write HTML, and the pages can have a lot of lines of HTML code. With this, it could be very tough to review and find any errors, and one error, such as not correctly closing a tag can completely break a site. As well, with newer versions of HTML, like HTML5, it could require a lot of time in maintenance and upgrading, especially to align with best practices.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

I think the biggest key to remembering how to write HTML is repetition and practice. Having learned and had previous experience using HTML beforehand, I’ve never had many issues remembering how tags and the syntax, just with picking it up better.
