# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

I learned about meditation, mindfulness, learning ruby the hard way, a growth mindset, the Pomodoro technique, starting small, habits, and tricks for getting in the zone at work. “Time Boxing” is setting a time for a task and then time for review and evaluation. The important aspect of a time box is that you will not necessarily complete a goal during this time parameter, but you are working to gradually complete the goal and evaluate and review at each break seeing whether the goal has been reached or what you accomplished during that time. I can use this technique in Phase 0 by devoting a specific amount of time to work/study at once, analyzing and reviewing what I did in that time, and then taking breaks instead of working until burnout without reviewing or analyzing my progress. Currently, I think I do a good job of managing my time. I think I can better strategize and organize how I am completing tasks, but in working on projects I have always been able to manage my time effectively, and have never missed a deadline on a project. One thing I do to manage my time is I usually take on the most difficult tasks first since I know those will take me the longest times, and then complete the smaller/easier tasks, or ones I enjoy the most after. It’s kind of a personal reward-based system for me, and I also know that the smaller or easier tasks for me will not be as stressful and I can knock them out with more ease. Most the time management techniques and productivity ideas I learned about I can implement. Most notably, I’ve always been interested in meditation, and I’m excited to use the app Headspace to start. I also think mindfulness, and using a variation of the Pomodoro technique will come in handy to me. In implementing a ninja mindset, I can become more productive and reduce stress, which really appeals to me. As for the Pomodoro technique, it will definitely be an adjustment for me to cut down to 25minute sessions and then a break since I am very used to getting into a zone and just keep going, but in implementing a better technique with breaks I will better be able to analyze what I am doing and grow from this evaluation. My overall plan for time management in Phase 0 will be to hopefully spread out the work over the course of the week instead of packing it all into a day or two. To do this, I will devote at least 2 hours per day to work and study, which will help me stay focused and immersed in the material and get in a solid mindset throughout this phase.

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

A shell is a highly configurable and customizable interpreter; it gives you the interface to program (it is the terminal). Bash is the shell and the command language you use in the shell (terminal). I didn’t think the material was overly challenging, just a lot of depth. I’ve used Terminal commands before so it wasn’t too difficult for me to pick up and become familiar with all the commands. At first, the Steven Harms video was a little confusing to keep up with, but the Command Line Crash Course really cleared everything up. I was successfully able to use all the commands, and while I was familiar with using the Terminal coming in, this material really enforced the power and capability that the command line has, and what you are able to do. I think the most important commands and arguments to know are the navigation, viewing, system, find, and help commands (**pwd, ls, cd, find, man, env**). That maybe a lot, but I think these are the most important because you need to be able to know where you are operating, what you’re operating on, and how to move around directories (**cd**). When you know this, then you can use the find command to find what you are looking for, and the help (manuals) to dig further and find out how/what you want to do.

These commands do:

**pwd =** Print working directory, or shows the directory (folder) where you operating

**ls =** Lists files in the directory you are in

**mv =** move files, which is a little misleading since is used to rename

**cd =** change directory, essential for navigating in bash

**. ./ =** This can be either “./” which we learned in the Steven Harms video is to run a program, or this can be referring that a “/” is used to identify the file is a directory

**touch =** makes a file, such as a “.txt” file

**mkdir =** makes a new directory

**less =** shows the file but limited to the size of the page and not the full file (where you would use **cat**)

**rmdir =** removes a directory

**rm =** removes a file

**help =** This is just for a windows command line, for Mac we would use **man** for the manual pages.

# 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

To create a new repo you would open your web browser to your GitHub profile. You would then locate the “+” symbol near the top of the page and click, “New repository,” fill out the form it takes you to, and then click “Create repository.” You can now clone this repo to your local machine. On your GitHub profile you should see this repo you just created, once you click in, you should see a text field with a URL that appears next to a button that says “SSH.” COPY this URL. At this point you can open up terminal, and navigate to the desired location where you want the repo to live on your local machine, and type “git clone <URL OF YOUR REPO YOU COPIED>”. Your repo is now on your local machine at the location you set. To fork a repo this would be done the same way, but you must first fork the repo to YOUR profile. To do this, you would open up the repo you want to fork on someone else’s GitHub profile. You would click the “Fork” button near the upper right of their profile, and select your profile to fork too. The repo will then show up on your profile as well. At this point you can copy the URL inside this repo from your profile, and follow the same “git clone” steps as I mentioned previously.

Forking a repo is different than creating a new repo. It is different because instead of copying a repo, and working together on the same code, you are copying a repo from someone else from a specific point and branching out on your own. These repos now function completely independently from one another, and you are not working together. On the contrary, instead of forking you could clone a repo, if you chose to collaborate, and you would then be working off the same code, and version control would come into play to merge to the master code from your own branches.

I did not have much trouble setting up git and GitHub. This was due to my previous knowledge and experience working with the two before. When I did set these up for the first time in the past I did have much more issues however. This was due to my lack of command line coding experience, and instead of using git commands in the command line I instead would download a repo and link through the GitHub desktop app. This caused more issues, and I didn’t quite fully understand git or GitHub back then. In going through the previous materials, and having a much better understanding of the command line and git/GitHub, this was much more fluid of a process for me. As well, it is much easier and much more efficient to use git commands and the command line to control your GitHub repos than by using the app or website.
