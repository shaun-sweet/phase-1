# Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

To create a repo on GitHub you would click the "+" icon on your github profile towards the top of the screen, and "New repository". You would complete the form, and click "Create repository". On this page you would copy the URL next to the SSH button. Open up your command line, and navigate using `pwd` and `cd` to where you want this repository to live on your local computer, and then type `git clone <URL YOU COPIED>`. This new repository would now be on your local computer.


# Describe what open source means.

Open source software is a practice that allows source code software to be shared, and customizable by anyone. It allows software to be distributed freely to build on and use. It allows for collaboration, and public development of software.


# What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I see both the pros and cons of Open Source. I think that it is great that the development community is so strong and together, and source code can be shared and expanded upon. With this distribution, it is great for learning and expanding your skills, or being able to use open source code as part of the software you build. It’s also great for the support system, and shared knowledge and improvement that can come with open source. There are cons too however, such as support can be inconsistent or not beneficial to you. There can be software that is not as desirable for others to work on in which case you will not get as much support, or you can receive support that is not up to standard or above your knowledge. Open source can also lead to a dependence on the support system, and if this system is not strong a project can die. Another factor with open source is that the since any developer can build and add to the code, this can be used for malicious intent and attacks. In all, I have a mixed feeling on Open Source. I think it is great for constant learning and getting a start in development and writing software, but at the same time it makes me nervous to put my code out, and leave me more vulnerable. Building off this, it feels like a utopia for learning and expanding on your knowledge.


# Assess the importance of using licenses.

It’s really important to use licenses. Mainly it protects you as the creator of your code and software, and allows you to receive this credit as such. It’s also important to choose the right license, and know what this means. By spending a little extra time at the beginning of your project to identify and choose the right license will save you that much more in the long run.


# What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

I think this challenge really solidified working with Git and GitHub. Having previous knowledge and experience working on the front-end side, and with Git/GitHub, and GH Page there weren’t any real “aha” moments for me. However to take the time to really learn and understand licenses was very beneficial, and critical to learn about.


# Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

As mentioned, having previous experience with this material really helped me, and this material reinforced that knowledge to me.
